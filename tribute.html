                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen "A. P. J." Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
                 A career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                 He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
                 and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
                 He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                 He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn.
                He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
                After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
                He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
                While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
                Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".
                He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
